# Flask on Docker with Postgres, Gunicorn, and Nginx  

## üìå Overview  
This repository sets up a **Flask web service** running inside Docker, backed by **Postgres**, with **Gunicorn** handling WSGI requests and **Nginx** as a reverse proxy. It also supports **static and media file uploads**, making it a production-ready web app setup.

The project follows a **step-by-step containerization process**:
- **Flask** for the backend
- **Docker & Docker Compose** for container orchestration
- **PostgreSQL** as the database
- **Gunicorn** as the WSGI server
- **Nginx** as the reverse proxy for performance and security
- **Static & media file handling** through Nginx
